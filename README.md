This project presents a Multi-Output Demographic Predictor, utilizing a ResNet50 deep learning model refined with transfer learning and a multi-output architecture to concurrently estimate gender, age, height, and weight directly from input images, deployed via an interactive Streamlit application. The necessity of this work lies in demonstrating end-to-end ML system development, applying advanced multi-task learning with CNNs, and showcasing deployment skills. The broader field of demographic estimation via computer vision has numerous potential applications: in Health & Fitness for tracking attributes or contactless screening; Security & Surveillance for identifying individuals or analyzing behavior patterns using age/gender cues; Retail & Advertising for anonymized customer demographic analysis and targeted content; Smart Mirrors/Virtual Try-On requiring body dimension predictions; and Gaming/Metaverse for realistic avatar creation. While this specific project's age/gender outputs could contribute to areas like retail analytics or avatar suggestions, its height/weight predictions derived from image features alone have limitations for high-accuracy tasks like virtual fitting or precise fitness tracking. Future advancements could involve improving model robustness and fairness, exploring fusion with other sensor data or landmark detection for better height/weight accuracy, expanding the range of predictable attributes, and optimizing for real-world deployment scenarios, always prioritizing ethical use and data privacy.
